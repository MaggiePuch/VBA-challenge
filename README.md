# VBA-challenge

For the VBA Challenge, I used the following websites as reference while creating my code:
  
  Website on how to use VBA Match
  https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/vba-match/

  VBA Auto Fit Columns
  https://excelchamps.com/vba/autofit/

  Website on how to use VBA Index Match 
  https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/vba-index-match/

I also had a zoom call with Sunshine from AskBCS Learning Assistant who helped me clarify clarify my code and better understand how VBA works. 

Thank you,
Maggie Puch
